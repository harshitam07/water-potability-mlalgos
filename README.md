Water Potability EDA and Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

This project utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the potability of water based on various quality parameters. The dataset includes factors such as pH, turbidity, dissolved CO2, conductivity, hardness, alkalinity, free chlorine, and more. By analyzing these parameters, the model determines whether a water sample is healthy or unhealthy. The repository covers data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of multiple ML algorithms to achieve optimal prediction accuracy. This project aims to enhance water quality assessment and demonstrate the practical application of machine learning in ensuring safe drinking water. 

The dataset was extracted from kaggle and csv ahs been uploaded.
